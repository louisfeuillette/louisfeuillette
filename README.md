### Hi there 👋
I'm Louis, a junior fullstack developer 👨‍💻

I used to work in the digital marketing industry. Now that I've gotten into coding, I truly enjoy solving problems

I'm currently open to opportunities and actively looking for a meaningful experience where I could solve real company challenges

- 🔭 I'm train myself to clone existing apps to face issues they might have encounter and see how I solve them by myself.
- 🌱 I’m exploring Python as a backend solution with Flask
- 📫 You can contact me anytime by email: louis.feuillette@outlook.com
